        <p> Thank you for visitng my first webpage. Let me introduce myself, my name is Tay. Nice to meet you!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a late 20s bloomer, pursuing a new career in coding. For most of my life, I have only <em>dabbled</em> in computer science. 
            I never took it seriously when younger,  I took classes in programming because I thought it was fun creating a program for a fake business back in high school. 
            I had the most in those days,  I created a business, wrote a  simplistic POS program,  I even named my “company”, Funky Monkey Honky Tonk Café. 
            Yes, my creativity was at its peak back then! However, as with most persons being introduced to adulthood, I was faced with making a career choice,  
            I chose medical science due to parental pressure. 
            I have no regrets! My journey led me back to my fond teenage days. A career that you find fun is a career you can excel at,
             and this was meant for me!</p>
        <p> After many years of work in that field, I migrated to the US, and finally decided to take my passion to this field, 
            having always being interested it did not take much push to find a online certification course to begin my journey!
