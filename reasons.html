            <p> A lot of changes have been made in the world today, that we would not have imagined possible 10 years ago. Today's society thrives
                on technology, and if you have a good business sense, chances are you will know that it is inevitable to 'change with the times'.
                At some point, you must have asked yourself "Do you need a Website?" Great question, seeing that there are other sources that you can use to promote your business, such as TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, and many more. However, having your website can be much more beneficial, 
                and here are 3 reasons why your business should eventually move on to owning a website:
            </p>
            <h1> Three Reasons You Need a Website!</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#number1">Increasing Brand Awareness!</a></li>
                <li><a href="#number2">Your Website Will Work For You While You Sleep!</a></li>
                <li><a href="#number3">Confirming Your Credibility!</a></li>
            </ol>
            <div>
            <h2>Increasing Brand Awareness!</h2>
            <p id="number1">
            <img src="./public/img/pic 2 for reason.jpg"
     alt="Images of website address"/>
     Having a website allows you to create a degree of consumer recognition of a product by its name.
     Creating brand awareness is a critical step in promoting a new product or reviving an older brand.
     With this concept in mind, you will be able to distinguish your products from your competitors.
     Having such a virtual space will allow you to keep audiences aware of the latest updates, and use comments to gather valuable customer feedback. You will also be able to reply and build customer rapport.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Your Website Will Work For You While You Sleep!</h2>
            <p id="number2">
            <img src="./public/img/Sleeping work.jpg"
     alt="Sleeping Lady"/>
     Ticket systems allow you to accept and create invoices even if you aren't in the office, 
     meaning that the website can make money for your business while you sleep. This vastly reduces workload times.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Confirming Your Credibility!</h2>
            <p id="number3">
            <img src="./public/img/Pic 1 for reason.jpg"
     alt="Professional at work"/>
     Pretty much everyone in today's modern world understands that building a professional website involves some large investment, 
     which would most likely mean that the company has no intention to disappear anytime soon. With this sense of security,
      consumers are more likely to order from you.
